h2. Default Templates

This is a Rails plugin which allows you to specify a default template for a specific
action. For example, if we are rendering the "new" action for a "tasks" controller,
the plugin will look for app/views/tasks/new. If that template does not exist, it will
look for app/views/defaults/new instead.

(My new and edit templates just contain @render :partial => "form"@, so this plugin 
removes some clutter for me.)
